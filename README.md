# AwesomeScripts - Custom Configs and Various Templates

Special Repo for Custom Scripts and Offensive / Biased Programs of Various Programming Languages.
More Tool Configs are being added. Stay tuned for future updates.!
Kindly Double Check and Verify twice before running or executing any script or file in your computer.
I would say try everything in a sandbox environment. *(VMs or Containers)*
